# Dave Seymour

## Introduction

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Dave. In another life I was Sherlock Holmesâ€™ apprentice. In this life Iâ€™m an aspiring data analyst with a keen eye for detail and a knack for joining the dots.

## About Me

After over a decade of helping breweries to streamline their production and improve the quality of their beers Iâ€™m bringing my wealth of knowledge and transferable skills and making a career transition into the world of data analytics and software development using Python.

## Experience

### Professional Background

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to design and produce hundreds of unique beer recipes; to gather, analyse and apply data to achieve measureable results; and to lead and mentor talented teams. My strength lies in my adaptability and curiousity, and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges.

### Open Source Contributions

Since transitioning to tech, I've been introduced to diverse range of programming and data analysis skills, some of which are best showcased in projects such as:

- ([Amazon_Review_Python](https://github.com/davemakebeer/Amazon_Reviews_Python))
  - A work in progress, this program utilises NLP for sentiment analysis. These values are then to be analysed for trends and patterns.

- ([Insurance_Cost_Python](https://github.com/davemakebeer/Insurance_Cost_Predictions))
  - As part of my data science training course, theoretical insurance data is manipulated, processed and analysed, utilising machine learning to make predictions.
 
- ([Radiation_Levels_Python](https://github.com/davemakebeer/Radiation_Levels_Python))
  - A short program for gathering datapoints, making calculations and displaying results. Skills displayed: functions, lists, dictionaries, for loops, while loops, calculations, error handling.

## P.S.

In my spare time I enjoy the freedom of travelling in my campervan and taking photos.
