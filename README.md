### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hi, Iâ€™m Dave. In another life I was Sherlock Holmesâ€™ apprentice. In this life Iâ€™m an aspiring data analyst with a keen eye for detail and a knack for joining the dots.

#### After over a decade of helping breweries to streamline their production and improve the quality of their beers Iâ€™m bringing my wealth of knowledge and transferable skills and making a career transition into the world of data analytics and software development using Python.
